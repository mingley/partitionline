# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to the 0.x policy in [`docs/RELEASE.md`](docs/RELEASE.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `scripts/ci-auth-smoke.sh`: native Kafka SASL_SSL + SCRAM-SHA-256/512 smoke
  (private CA, isolated ports, `examples/sasl` with `TLS_CA_PEM`); TLS-only
  produce must fail closed. Wired into `scripts/ci-civilization-check.sh`.
- `examples/sasl` accepts optional `TLS_CA_PEM` / `TLS_SERVER_NAME` for the
  production SASL_SSL path.
- `scripts/owner-status.sh` prints Installable/Verifiable blocker status
  (token, crates.io, Actions tip/main); wired into civilization-check and
  publish-ready as an informational footer.
- CI concurrency cancels superseded runs on `main` too, so a stuck queued
  `main` job cannot permanently block the next push after merge.

### Changed

- Mock TLS fixtures use the `openssl` CLI instead of `rcgen`, dropping
  `time` from the dependency graph and clearing the `RUSTSEC-2026-0009`
  ignore in `deny.toml` / `.cargo/audit.toml` without raising MSRV.
- Auth smoke covers SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-512 over SASL_SSL; CI `test`
  jobs assert `openssl version` before `cargo test`.
- ADOPTION / CIVILIZATION record local civilization-check **26/26** evidence
  (broker + SASL_SSL SCRAM-256/512) while GitHub Actions remains queued.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-04

First crates.io release baseline (publish via `docs/RELEASE.md` / tag `v0.1.0`).

### Added

- Pure-Rust Kafka client: produce, fetch, classic groups, cooperative-sticky,
  KIP-848 consumer groups, KIP-932 share groups, transactions / EOS, and
  Kafka 3.x/4.x admin APIs.
- TLS via rustls (no OpenSSL); SASL PLAIN, SCRAM-SHA-256/512, OAUTHBEARER,
  OIDC client credentials.
- Compression: gzip, snappy, lz4 (zstd and Kerberos remain out of default
  features; see `docs/gaps.md` and `docs/zstd-spike.md`).
- Java-shaped builders and rustdoc naming matching Java client calls.
- Optional `tracing` feature (produce/fetch/poll/rejoin/txn spans).
- Examples: produce, consume, group, txn, eos, admin, tls, sasl, oauth, share,
  benches, interceptors, metrics (`FORMAT=prom`).
- Operator docs: guide, rdkafka migration, security, release policy,
  API stability, civilization plan.
- CI: mock tests (MSRV 1.85 + stable), clippy, audit, cargo-deny, `cargo package`,
  broker-smoke (Kafka 3.9.1 + 4.1.0), fuzz-smoke, latency-gate.
- libFuzzer targets under `fuzz/`; decode allocation DoS guards.
- TLS PEM parsing via `rustls-pki-types` (no archived `rustls-pemfile`).

### Fixed

- KIP-932 share groups on Kafka 4.1: join with a client Uuid member id, wait for
  a real heartbeat assignment (no zero topic id), decode null Assignment as
  INT8 `-1`, and use the group coordinator for membership. Share smoke needs
  `group.share.enable` and finalized `share.version=1`.

### Changed

- Lab A produce harness exits non-zero unless broker HW sum equals acked each run.
- Civilization/publish-ready gates verify a downstream crate can depend on the packed `.crate`.
- Release workflow accepts `workflow_dispatch` on an existing `v*` tag; rustdoc/`ci-docs` smoke is part of publish-ready.
- Fixed broken rustdoc `[Display]` intra-doc links (now `std::fmt::Display`).
- Cleared remaining unresolved rustdoc intra-doc links (module docs resolve in
  submodule scope; crate denies `rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links`; `ci-docs`
  fails the gate if any reappear).
- CI: `dev/**` branch pushes run a single `branch-lite` job; full matrix on
  pull_request, `main`, and `workflow_dispatch` so scarce runners can finish.
- Lab A harness accepts `TOPIC=` as well as `KAFKA_TOPIC=`; STATUS notes a
  fresh unsigned latency-gate + HW==acked smoke sample (not a Suite HOLD lift).
- `scripts/check-installable.sh` probes crates.io for the Installable bar;
  ADOPTION notes Actions is stuck org-wide (`main` queued for hours).
- `ci-broker-smoke`: when Docker overlay fails but `$KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP` is already
  up, fall back to that broker automatically (same path as `SKIP_DOCKER=1`).
- Fuzz: Join/Sync/Heartbeat/OffsetCommit + ShareFetch decode targets; Lab A
  fetch integrity harness (`scripts/lab-a-fetch.sh`) requires consumed==seeded
  (unsigned; not a Suite HOLD lift).
- `examples/oauth` for OAUTHBEARER (unsecured JWT) and OIDC client-credentials;
  ADOPTION documents pinable `v0.1.0-rc.1` git install until crates.io lands.
- Broker smoke: Kafka CI matrix uses `apache/kafka:4.1.0`; Docker 4.x starts with
  share coordinator RF=1 and upgrades `share.version=1`; `REQUIRE_SHARE=1` fails
  the job if share cannot fetch records on 4.x. Civilization-check only counts
  broker smoke when the log contains `ci-broker-smoke: ok` (Docker soft-skips
  are not evidence).

### Security

- Reject array / tagged-field lengths that exceed remaining buffer bytes so
  malformed broker frames cannot force multi-gigabyte `Vec` allocations.

### Notes

- Not a drop-in for `rd_kafka_*` or rust-rdkafka types.
- Defaults that differ from Java: `auto.offset.reset=Earliest`,
  `allow.auto.create.topics=false`, shorter `delivery.timeout.ms` /
  `max.block.ms` (see README).
- Mock TLS fixtures use the `openssl` CLI (no `rcgen` / `time` in the graph).
